# Terminal Exit Guide

This repository contains resources to help with terminal exit issues when running Python scripts that use matplotlib animations.

## The Problem

When running Python scripts that create matplotlib animations, the terminal may sometimes hang and not exit properly after the script completes. This is often due to animation objects being kept alive in memory or interactive mode (plt.ion()) being enabled without properly closing figures.

## Solutions

We've provided several resources to help you address this issue:

1. **terminal_guide.md**: A comprehensive guide with methods to terminate a hanging terminal on different operating systems.

2. **terminal_exit_example.py**: A simple example script that demonstrates how to properly close matplotlib figures to ensure the terminal exits properly.

3. **test_terminal_fix.py**: A test script that runs try778.py with a smaller number of episodes and ensures all matplotlib figures are closed.

## Key Points

To prevent terminal hanging issues:

1. Always use `plt.close('all')` at the end of scripts that use matplotlib
2. Avoid keeping references to animation objects unless necessary
3. Use `plt.ion()` and `plt.ioff()` appropriately

## Quick Fix

If your terminal is currently hanging, press `Ctrl+C` to interrupt the running process. If that doesn't work, refer to terminal_guide.md for more methods.
